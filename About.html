    <h1 class="titleAbout">About Baby Blues♡</h1>
    <p class= "bigText">
        Baby Blues is a start-up that’s still in its early stages.
        It’s a start-up that aims to help make mental health support for
        mothers more accessible. We’re hoping that this platform can turn
        into a community of women supporting other women. A place you can
        come to and share your experiences, read about the experiences of
        others, or just learn something new.

        The inspiration for Baby Blues was born after research investigating
        the effectiveness of technology-delivered therapy for perinatal depression,
        we looked at cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and found that it can be
        just as effective without the presence of a mental health professional. This research took place between March
        and September of 2020, which was the beginning of COVID-19 and what feels like a never-ending lockdown. During
        this time, we have seen a rise in people experiencing mental health crises and yet mental health care is still
        not reaching those who desperately need it.

        Even before the pandemic, affordable mental health care has been associated with long waiting times and feels
        like a hassle. Meanwhile, private routes to mental health care are expensive and branded as a luxury. Mental
        health apps and online interventions are nothing new and are becoming increasingly popular, but there is still a
        gap when it comes to maternal mental health.

        This is where Baby Blues comes in. Baby Blues is a mobile app that is coming soon to iOS with plans for a later
        release on Android. It is an app that will mimic aspects of CBT and especially psychoeducation through a series
        of low-cost weekly sessions that will run for five months. It is tailored for pregnant women and new
        mothers. Baby Blues is not exclusively for women who have a diagnosis of depression, it is for everyone that is
        dealing with the highs and lows of pregnancy and motherhood.
